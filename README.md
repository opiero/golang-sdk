# MercadoLibre's Golang SDK

This is an unofficial fork of Golang SDK for MercadoLibre's Platform.

## How do I install it?

You can download the latest build from [here](https://github.com/opiero/golang-sdk/archive/master.zip).

## How do I install it using go:

Just run the following command within your $GOPATH

```bash
go get github.com/opiero/golang-sdk/sdk
```

And that's it!

## How do I start using it?

You can start integrating with https://api.mercadolibre.com by doing the following:

```go
client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, UserCode, ClientSecret, RedirectURL)
```

**ClientID:** Is the id that was given to you when you registered your application by using _Application Manager_. For additional help you can access our [Developer's Site](http://developers.mercadolibre.com/register-your-application/).

**ClientSecret:** Is a secret which is created during the complition of the step above.

**UserCode:** Is a code which is asigned to a specific user when this one tryies to access a private mercadolibre API. It means that to get this code you will need to authenticate and authorize the user.

**RedirectURL:** This is the url where the user will be redirected once it is authorized by mercadolibre.

To obtain the **UserCode** named above you will have to redirect the user to a specific url. To build this url, you can use the following code:

```go
url := sdk.GetAuthURL(ClientID, sdk.AuthURLMLA, "https://www.example.com")
```

As a result, you will need to somehow make the user to enter his/her credentials in that URL. Once mercadolibre api authenticates the user, a redirection url will be returned and the **UserCode** will come attached to it. (i.e https://www.example.com?code=TG-57f2b6c7e4b08aea0070353e-214509008)

**Warning**: This **UserCode** needs to be parsed and kept by your application in order to be used for later instantiate the Meli client.

Now you can instantiate another `Meli` object, but this time ** this object will allow you to access the private API and also will manage the token refreshing, so you do not need to worrie about this handshake**

There are some design considerations worth to mention.

This SDK is just a thin layer on top of an http client to handle all the OAuth WebServer flow for you.

## Making GET calls to public API

```go
// UserCode can be empty since neither authorization nor authentication is needed.
client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, UserCode, ClientSecret, "www.example.com")
resp, err := client.Get("/users/me")

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error %s\n", err.Error())
}
userInfo, _:= ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
fmt.Printf("response:%s\n", userInfo)

```

## Making GET calls to a private API

```go
var client *sdk.Meli

if  client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, "", ClientSecret, redirectURL); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error: ", err.Error())
    return
}

var response *http.Response
if response, err = client.Get("/users/me"); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error: ", err.Error())
    return
}

// If the API requires authorization you need to redirect the user.
// Once the user enters his/her credentials, you need to use the UserCode to instantiate a new client, but this time it will be able to query private APIs.

if response.StatusCode == http.StatusForbidden {
    url := sdk.GetAuthURL(ClientID, sdk.AuthURLMLA, "www.example.com")
    log.Printf("Returning Authentication URL:%s\n", url)
    http.Redirect(w, r, url, 301)
}

// Once the user was redirected and a UserCode was received:
if  client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, CODE_JUST_OBTEINED, ClientSecret, redirectURL); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error: ", err.Error())
    return
}
```

## Making POST calls

```go
client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, ClientCode, ClientSecret, "https://www.example.com")

body := "{\"title\":\"Item de test - No Ofertar\",\"category_id\":\"MLA1912\",\"price\":10,\"currency_id\":\"ARS\",\"available_quantity\":1,\"buying_mode\":\"buy_it_now\",\"listing_type_id\":\"bronze\",\"condition\":\"new\",\"description\": \"Item:,  Ray-Ban WAYFARER Gloss Black RB2140 901  Model: RB2140. Size: 50mm. Name: WAYFARER. Color: Gloss Black. Includes Ray-Ban Carrying Case and Cleaning Cloth. New in Box\",\"video_id\": \"YOUTUBE_ID_HERE\",\"warranty\": \"12 months by Ray Ban\",\"pictures\":[{\"source\":\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Ray_Ban_Original_Wayfarer.jpg\"},{\"source\":\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teashades.gif\"}]}"

resp, err = client.Post("/items", body)

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error %s\n", err.Error())
}
userInfo, _= ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
fmt.Printf("response:%s\n", userInfo)

```

## Making PUT calls

```go
client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, ClientCode, ClientSecret, "https://www.example.com")
change := "{\"available_quantity\": 6}"

resp, err = client.Put("/items/" + item.Id, &change)

if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error %s\n", err.Error())
}
userInfo, _= ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
fmt.Printf("response:%s\n", userInfo)
```

## Making DELETE calls

```go
client, err := sdk.Meli(ClientID, ClientCode, ClientSecret, "https://www.example.com")
client.Delete("/items/123")
```

## Community

You can contact us if you have questions using the standard communication channels described in the [Developer's Forum](http://developers-forum.mercadolibre.com/).

## I want to contribute!

That's great! Pull requests are very welcome!

Just fork the project in GitHub. Create a topic branch, write some code and add some tests for your new code.
You can find some examples by taking a look at the main.go file.

To run the tests run `make test`.

**Be aware:** Please, make sure all tests are passing before committing any change. Any pull request with failing tests will be automatically discarded.

Thanks for helping!
